# LNP Unblocker
### Chrome extension for unblocking paywalled articles on lancasteronline.com

This Google Chrome extension will allow you to read lancasteronline.com uninhibited without a subscription of any kind. Currently, when you click an article, the entire page will be loaded including the article. Then, the paywall will obscure the content with a bit of JavaScript. This extension is very minimal and simply reverses this action.

## Installation
* Clone or download & unzip this repo
* Go to chrome://extensions/
* In upper right, turn on Developer Mode
* Now, in upper left, click "Load unpacked"
* Select the entire lnp-unblocker folder (don't open) to load
